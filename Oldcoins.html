    <h1> OLD COINS OF INDIA </h1>
    <p> After Indian independence, British Indian coins were in use as a frozen currency until
      India became a republic in 1950. The first rupee coins of the Republic of India were minted
      in 1950.These included 1/2 rupee, 1/4 rupee, 2 anna, 1 anna, 1/2 anna & 1 pice coins,
      and are referred to as the anna series or pre-decimal coinage. Under the anna series, one
       rupee was divided into 16 annas or 64 pice, with each anna equal to 4 pice. </p>
